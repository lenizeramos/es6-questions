**Spread & Rest Operators:**

**Given the two arrays of string `fruitBasket` and `additionalFruits` and three objects `studentInfo`, `person1` and `person2`, please complete the following questions.**

```javascript
const fruitBasket = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
const additionalFruits = ["date", "elderberry"];
const studentInfo = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const person1 = { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" };
const person2 = { age: 30, job: "Engineer" };
```

**Questions:**

1. **Combine Arrays:** Use the spread operator to combine the `fruitBasket` and `additionalFruits` arrays into a single array.

2. **Clone an Array:** Create a copy of the `fruitBasket` array using the spread operator and modify one of the arrays to show that they are independent.

3. **Spread in Object:** Create a new object that includes the properties of `studentInfo` and an additional property `grade` using the spread operator.

4. **Rest Parameters in Function:** Write a function that accepts any number of arguments using rest parameters and calculates their sum.

5. **Spread in Function Call:** Use the spread operator to pass the elements of an array as arguments to a function.

6. **Merging Objects:** Merge two objects, `person1` and `person2`, into a single object using the spread operator. Handle cases where they have overlapping properties.

7. **Spread in Function Parameters:** Write a function that accepts two objects as parameters and combines their properties into a new object using the spread operator.

8. **Destructuring and Spread:** Destructure an object into individual variables and then spread them into a new object with a modified property.

9. **Rest Operator in Array:** Create a function that receives an array and returns the first element as the result and the rest of the elements as an array using the rest operator.

10. **Spread in Object Properties:** Create a new object with the properties of `studentInfo`, but change the value of the "age" property to 30 using the spread operator.
